# partition
 Code for partitionning list of Integers from a required sublist size.
 
 For example, considering a list of integers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and a sublist size set to a value of 2, the function partion will return a list containing sublists from the incoming list with a size less than or equal to the required sublist size. Consequently, the result will be [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]].
 
 This has been created due to a skill test required by Adneom.
 
 This repository contains the source code, the test code ans the target generated archives.
